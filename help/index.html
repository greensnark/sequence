<p>SEQUENCE is a program for producing UML Sequence Diagrams. In contrast to most similar programs you don't actually
draw the diagram. Instead you write a textual description of the method calls you want to diagram and the layout is
calculated and drawn automatically.</p>

<p>Although you don't have the exact control over the layout that a drawing program gives
you I think this has a couple of advantages. Firstly, it's much quicker to express what you want this way, and that is
the point of the diagrams after all. Secondly, I find it easier to achieve a good looking result this way rather than
having to manually position each element.</p>

<p>For instance the diagram below is easy to define.</p>

<p><img src="diagram1.png"></p>

<p>You just have to write this description.</p>

<pre>
foo {
  bar.baz -> obj;
  bar.foop(obj);
}
</pre>

<p>The more complete example show below is provided by the <code>Example</code> option under the <code>Help</code> menu.
It demonstrates most of the features of the language used to describe sequence diagrams.</p>

<p>This description is used to produce the diagram.</p>

<pre>
Comments.newComment {
  CommentFactory.newComment -> "the new comment" {
    Comment.<<create>> {
      IDGen.nextID -> newId;
      Transaction.add(this);
      Comments.getSize -> size;
    }
  Comments.addToCache(the new comment);
  }
}
</pre>
