<p>You can run SEQUENCE without displaying a screen. In this mode it reads an input file provided on the command line
and writes out a file containing an image of the resulting sequence diagram in <code>.png</code> format. You
need to supply the <code>--headless</code> command line option and follow it by the name of the file containing the
text describing the diagram. The name of the output file is formed by stripping the last extension off the input file
name and then appending <code>.png</code>.</p>
